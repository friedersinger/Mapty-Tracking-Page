# Mapty - Tracking Website

#### Website: <https://mapty-tracking.netlify.app>

#### Description:

This program is a web application that allows users to track their workouts, such as running and cycling. It has a form for users to input details about their workouts, including the type of workout, distance traveled, duration, cadence (for running), and elevation gain (for cycling). When a user submits the form, a new workout is created and added to a list of workouts. The program also displays a map and plots the route of each workout on the map. The program saves the list of workouts in the user's local storage, so that the workouts persist even if the user closes the web page or browser.
